## 1. Chlorophyll Extraction

### Materials

-   [ ] Acetone (2 mL per sample)
-   [ ] Ice
-   [ ] 1,000 µL pipette and tips (2 tips per sample)
-   [ ] Vortexter
-   [ ] Centrifuge
-   [ ] Kimwipes

### Method

::: callout-caution
Chlorophyll is very unstable. Always keep samples on ice and if possible in darkness.
:::

1.  Take rack with sample tubes
2.  Centrifuge up to 24 sample tubes using rotor 12154 for 5 min at 12,000 rpm at 4°C. Keep centrifuge balanced.
3.  Remove supernatant with 1,000 µL pipette. Remove remaining drops of supernatant with Kimwipes.
4.  Add 1,000 µL acetone and close tube. Homogenize with pipette and vortex for 15 s. Do not re-use tips.
5.  Extract chlorophyll for 24 h at 4 °C (Fridge Biomol 2). Keep samples wrapped in aluminium foil.

## 2. Chlorophyll Measurement

#### Overview {#overview}

The chlorophyll concentration ($µg~mL^{-1}$) is calculated based on the formulas given in [@jeffrey1975]:

$$
\text{Chlorophyll}~a = 11.43 \frac{A_{663} - A_{750}}{PL}  – 0.64\frac{A_{630} - A_{750}}{PL}
$$

, where $A_{663}$, $A_{630}$, and $A_{750}$ is the absorption at 663, 630, and 750 nm, and $PL$ the path length of the cuvette (1 cm).

#### BioTek Photometer

The photometer can read whole plates (96 samples). However, since acetone is used to extract the chlorophyll quartz cuvette has to be used instead of plates made of plastic. The software of the photometer still visualizes the measurements of this cuvette as a plate which can be confusing.

The photometer will automatically measure the absorbtion at 663, 630, and 750 nm and does the blank-correction automatically. Each measurement is done twice and blanks are measured at the beginning and after 10 samples, resulting in the following plate outlay:

[BLK]{style="background-color: #80FFFE"} corresponds to blank measurements and [SPLXX]{style="background-color: #A6CAEE"} to samples.

Please follow the steps described in **XX** to enter the metadata (which sample is at which position, file names, etc).

### Materials

-   [ ] Vortexter
-   [ ] Acetone
-   [ ] Ice
-   [ ] Kimwipes
-   [ ] 1000 µL pipette & tips
-   [ ] BioTek **XXX**
-   [ ] Quartz cuvette (dark and shattered)

### Method

1.  After the incubation (note down incubation time), vortex samples for 15 s and centrifuge samples using rotor 12154 for 5 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Keep samples on ice and in darkness. Transport samples carefully to not damage the pellet.

2.  Turn on BioTek photometer and connect to Dell via USB

3.  Double-click on `2024_04_20_chlorophyll+carotinoides_andi.prt` to start software (backup stored [here](photometer_configuration/2024_04_20_chlorophyll+carotinoides_andi.prt))

4.  Click on `Create experiment and read now`:

5.  At first, the photometer measures without any cuvette. Follow the instructions in the pop-up and click `OK`.

    ![](images/clipboard-2278673067.png){width="350"}

6.  Start measuring the blank. To do so, add 500 µL acetone into quartz cuvette and insert into photometer. Click `OK` in pop-up window.

    ![](images/clipboard-3845169148.png){width="350"}

7.  Repeat blank measurement. Click on `Oui` in pop-up window.

    ![](images/clipboard-70391127.png){width="350"}

8.  Measure first sample. Remove cuvette from photometer, clean with Kimwipes and add 500 µL sample extract. Click on `Oui` in pop-up window (as for second blank measurement).

9.  Repeat measurement (click `Oui`).

10. Remove cuvette from photometer, clean with acetone and Kimwipes and measure next sample.

11. Repeat as described before for 10 samples (i.e. 20 measurements). Then, measure blank as described before (2x) and continue to measure samples.

::: callout-note
If you do a mistake in the sequence of measurements, correct it accordingly in the table (see [Problems])
:::

8.  When finished or after measuring 43 sampels, click on `Non` in pop-up window.

9.  Save experiment in your folder. Name it as follows:

    `YYYY_MM_DD_chl_adaptome_#.xpt`

    , where `YYYY_MM_DD` is the date and `#` the batch number (each day, start with `1`), e.g. `2024_11_19_chl_adaptome_1.xpt`.

10. To export the data, click on `Export`.

    ![](images/Capture%20d'écran%202024-11-19%20161812.png){width="350"}

11. Save data as `.txt` (default) in your folder and name it `YYYY_MM_DD_chl_adaptome_#.txt` (as described above).

::: callout-caution
Backup your data each day you are measuring. Either upload the folder to Google Drive or save it on a USB key. Keep all data also on the computer.
:::

## Problems

If the sequence of the measurements does not fit anymore to the assumed layout (see [plate overview](#plateoverview)), the blank-correction does not work anymore. You can correct this by changing the `type` column for the corresponding positions (see **metadata** for more details).
