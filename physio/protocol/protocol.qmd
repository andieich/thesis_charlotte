# Introduction

## Aim

Measurement of chlorophyll a concentration and Symbiodiniaceae density

## Overview workflow

### **General remark**

Chlorophyll degrades quickly under high temperatures and light. Keep the samples on ice and the lab as dark as possible.

### **Remove coral tissue**

An air gun is used to blow off the corals tissue in sterile filtrated seawater. The tissue slurry is collected in a zip-lock bag and transferred into a 50 mL tube. After centrifugation to remove excess water, the slurry is sub-sampled for chlorophyll extraction and Symbiodiniaceae counts.

### **Extract chlorophyll**

Chlorophyll is extracted in acetone and the concentration measured with a photometer

### **Symbiodiniaceae counts**

For six sub samples, the Symbiodiniaceae are counted with a hemocytometer

### **Surface area**

The chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodiniaceae counts have to be normalized to the tissue surface area of the coral fragment. The area is estimated by comparing the weight of the coral fragment before and after coating it with paraffin wax.

## Workflow

::: callout-note
Chlorophyll is very unstable. Always keep samples on ice and if possible in darkness.
:::

### 1. Remove coral tissue

::: callout-note
Work in batches of 6 six samples at a time.
:::

1.  Transfer coral fragment into `ziplock bag` and add enough `SSW` to immerse sample. Use an air gun to remove all coral tissue. Afterwards, the whit coral skeleton should be visible.
    1.  Store the skeleton in a solution of `50% bleach` until measuring the surface area.
2.  Transfer tissue slurry into a pre-weighted (taraed) `500 mL beaker`. Note the weight to estimate the volume of the tissue slurry.
3.  Homogenize tissue slurry for `30 - 60 s`. Clean homogenizer with `SSW` and wipe dry.
4.  Transfer about 40 g tissue slurry into pre-weigh (taraed) `50 mL tube`. Try to be exact to keep the centrifuge used later balanced.
5.  Centrifuge the 6 sample tubes using `rotor 19676` for `20 min` at `9,000 rpm` at `4 °C`.
6.  With a `1000 mL pipette`, remove as much supernatant as possible without damaging the pellet. Vortex to re-suspend remaining tissue slurry.
7.  Centrifuge for `10 min` with the other settings as in step 5. Repeat steps 6 - 7 until all supernatant could be removed.
8.  Add `3,000 mL SSW` and vortex until solution is homogeneous. Divide solution for chlorophyll analysis (`1,000 mL)` and Symbiodiniaceae counts (`1,000 mL`). Store all samples at 4 °C, keep chlorophyll samples wrapped in aluminium foil.

### 2. Chlorophyll

1.  Centrifuge sample tubes using `rotor 12154` for `5 min` at `12,000 rpm` at `4 °C`.

2.  Remove supernatant with `1,000 mL pipette`. Remove remaining drops of supernatant wit paper tissue.

3.  Add `1,000 mL acetone` and close tube. Homogenize with pipette and vortex for `15 s`.

4.  Extract chlorophyll for `24 h` at `4 °C`.

5.  Vortex samples for `15 s` and centrifuge samples using `rotor 12154` for `5 min` at `12,000 rpm` at `4 °C`. Keep samples on ice and in darkness. Transport samples carefully to not damage the pellet.

6.  Measure `500 ml` of the chlorophyll extract in duplicates against an acetone blank. Re-blank after 10 samples. Refer to **XXX** **protocol** for these measurements and the data export.

### 3. Symbiodiniaceae counts

1.  Clean haemocytometer with `96% EtOH`.
2.  Vortex sample for `15 s`.
3.  Add `10 µL` sample solution into each of the 2 chamber in the haemocytometer.
