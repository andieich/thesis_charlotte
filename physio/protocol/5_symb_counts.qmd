## Method

1.  Clean haemocytometer with 96% EtOH and Kimwipes
2.  Vortex sample for 15 s.
3.  Add 10 µL sample solution into each of the 2 chamber in the haemocytometer. If necessary, dillute 200 mL samples in 800 µL SST.
4.  Count Symbiodiniaceae in both chambers and repeat 3 times per samples (6 count replicates per sample). If counts differ by more than 20%, repeat another time.
5.  Between each count, clean haemocytometer with 96% EtOH and Kimwipes. Vortex tubes between counts,
